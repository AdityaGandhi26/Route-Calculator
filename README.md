# Route-Calculator
Python Script to Calculate various routes between locations

The script was made and tested using Pyzo for Windows.

The code could be made more elegant as there is a bit of repitition withing some functions, however, for the purpose of this script and the test, I have chosen to keep them as separate functions.

To run file:

Open in Pyzo
Create a default Python Shell
Click Run -> Run File As Script
Then in the command shell - type runCalc()

This will output the results for all the test cases required.
